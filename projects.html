						<h3>Python Project for NetApp</h3>
						<p>
							While working for Ennovar contracted out to NetApp we were tasked to create a Python program to run off a bootable USB using Docker that would collect the support bundles on their machines and parse the logs using regular expressions to look for specific hardware failure signatures. The idea was that when a malfunctioning piece of hardware was returned this tool could be used to quickly identify which pieces of hardware had failed.

						<h3>Senior Design Project</h3>
						<p>
							For my senior design project I am working as part of a team in conjunction with the city of Wichita. Due to intellectual property issues the city made us sign a non-disclosure agreement, but what I can say is that I've learned a lot working on this project. Previously I had no web development experience, but for this project I am working with Django to provide a backend for our website. This has been a tremendously educational and rewarding experience.

						<h3>Website Design</h3>
						<p>
							Working with the city for my senior project was my first foray into the field of web development and I was immediately hooked. I have been building this website as a playground to try out new features and things I am continuing to learn. As I learn and get better hopefully this site will reflect that growth.
