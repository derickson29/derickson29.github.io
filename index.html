			<h1>Computer Science Student</h1>
			<p>
			My goal is to attain a development position where I can put to professional use the programming skills I have gained from my coursework. I am passionate about programming and eager to begin my career as a developer. I have experience in C++, Python, and Javascript. I am always keen to learn new languages/frameworks. My  favorite aspect of programming is that you are never done learning. There is always something new to tackle and Wichita State has equipped me with the knowledge and desire to meet new challenges head on.

				<h3>Projects</h3>
				<p>
					Side projects are how I like to spend my free time when I'm not in school or working. I have been working on my senior design project involving my first taste of web development, a python programming project for NetApp, and this website itself!
